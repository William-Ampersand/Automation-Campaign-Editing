/*HOW TO
This script is for adding your cars to competitors.db. If you have a Competitors.db and want thumbnails, you need the other script!

Find your Competitors.db in SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Automation\UE427\AutomationGame\Content\GameData\Camso\tycoon
  Or go to your stream library, Browse Local Files for Automation, and follow the above file path
Make a backup copy!
Open Competitors.db in SQLite
Next, click "Attach Database" on the top bar of SQLite
Find your save file in %localappdata%\AutomationGame\Saved\UserData\Campaign, open it, and when asked what you want to call it, enter 'savegame' (no quotes)
Next find the "Execute SQL" tab, it's one row BELOW the Attach Database button
Copy this script into the space there, and run it! (F5)
Before you close SQLite, click "Write Changes" on top!
Now your cars are part of Competitors.db. Thumbnails will not appear until they are part of your SAVE GAME FILE, so you need the other script for that.

If you want to add cars from sandbox, select that instead of your campaign save game, and make the changes marked below. You will need to know your company name.

PRO TIP: If two trims in a facelift have the SAME TARGET MARKET, then ONLY ONE WILL BE USED! Set different target markets for each trim!

/*This will create a CompanySize table based on your highest market awareness.
Your company will not be visible in-game for any time frame which your save file did not play. EG if your save file is in Dec 1960, your company will disappear Jan 1961. If you started in 1960 your company will not be visible before then.
The Size value derived from your awareness is a placeholder. It is linear, but the real equation used is a curve. Note to self make this more accurate later.

/*Profile probably does nothing. Leaving it null still feels like bad juju.
Color appears in the sankey chart. Last two FF is alpha channel, leave it FF.
Use an online hex color picker and set the first 6 characters to whatever you want.*/
